Performing Analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
## Overview of Project

Louise is an upcoming playwright, who wants to start a crowdfunding campaign to help fund her play "Fever". She is estimating a budget of $10,000. 
Hence we need to analyze the crowdfunding data to see if there are any specific factors that make the project campaign sucessful. we will help Louise to 
set up her own campaign and set her up for success. Using excel to analyze the current site data will help her gain a greater understanding of campaigns from
start to finish and will be able to set her campaign to mirror other successful ones in the same category. we will help Louise kickstart her production.
